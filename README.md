Organization and systematic analysis to ID departments that should be under review

2014 / 140 view of Summer individuals had been listed as having a salary but no payments seem to have been made and the zero Claire Claire or categorization error

I also know that a lot of health department locations were listed with specific the other year would love for he knows not the case different keep it consistent I ever moved the specific identification card application

Also note that since the blue-chip and youth summer positions were removed post-2014 they were not included in the analysis of the state of either

Also interesting to note that five election judges were paid a small sum of cash even though all 22 judges were not listed as having an official salary

As a standard procedure three digit identification codes her Department were removed because it complicated the pivot charts to properly analyze the data

Two big formulas were used to filter the state of first people were removed whether or not they are currently working for the city and technically they were removed if they weren't continuously employed by the city

 some interesting findings

Of 8427 employees reviewed, 337 are underpaid 1147 are overpaid. The three most underpaid departments are parks and rec Recreation section, with 139 out of 196 employees being underpaid. Crossing guards 49 out of 195 being underpaid. In the health department itself 31 out of 472 underpaid. 

The most egregious offenders in order Police Department,  Department of Water Sanitation,  and Fire Department. 

Now we identified systemic over or under payment based upon how many standard deviations away from they're listed annual salary people were paid.  we also summed the difference between the gross and a listed rates for the past. 2014 2016 2018-2019. 

Should be noted that at least once an indication of away from your annual pay with needed to be identified under or over. Few individuals were listed as having underpaid consistently about below 3 standard. Hundreds of individuals were listed as being overpaid by as much as two standard deviations up to five. It should be noted that the majority of these overpaid individuals from work from the police department.
